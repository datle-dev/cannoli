# Cannoli

## About

Cannoli is a concept for a microblogging social media platform where users make posts with a limited set of words.
It's heavily inspired by [X (formerly known as Twitter)](https://x.com), [Magnetic Poetry](https://magneticpoetry.com/), and [Elden Ring's multiplayer message system](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messages).

This is a full-stack portfolio project using React (Typescript) as the front-end and Django (Python) as the back-end.
